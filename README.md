# Final Project Analysis

## Overview and Pulling Data 

This project investigates the role of pollinators in predicting the yield of wild blueberries, using a dataset collected in Maine, USA. Pollinators are often overlooked in agronomic modeling, despite their significant contribution to crop production. The goal of this project is to determine whether including pollinator data improves the accuracy of yield predictions.

## Objectives

- Model the influence of different types of pollinators (honeybees, bumblebees, and others) on blueberry yield.
- Use linear models and statistical tests to evaluate the strength of pollinator effects.
- Identify key predictors of crop yield and assess multicollinearity, residual patterns, and model assumptions.
