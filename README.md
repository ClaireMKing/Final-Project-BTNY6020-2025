# Final Project Analysis

## Overview and Pulling Data 

This project investigates the role of pollinators in predicting the yield of wild blueberries, using a dataset collected in Maine, USA. Pollinators are often overlooked in agronomic modeling, despite their significant contribution to crop production. The goal of this project is to determine whether including pollinator data improves the accuracy of yield predictions.

## Objectives

- Model the influence of different types of pollinators (honeybees, bumblebees, and others) on blueberry yield.
- Use linear models and statistical tests to evaluate the strength of pollinator effects.
- Identify key predictors of crop yield and assess multicollinearity, residual patterns, and model assumptions.

## Files

- `Final Project.Rmd` – Main analysis document
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions
- `Requirements.txt` – Packages needed for this analysis

---
## Analysis

To run this analysis, the previously mentioned RMD file needs to be loaded into R with all packages installed from the Requirements.txt file. Once this is complete, the user will need to simply run the file either in its entirely or in sections as they see fit. Either method will give the same result.

## Outputs

The output documents include:
- Data summaries
- Linear model diagnostics
- Interpretation of statistical results
- Policy and economic implications based on pollinator effects
